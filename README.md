# Intelligent Chatbot for Customer Support
AI-based chatbot for automated customer support using NLP
## Project Overview
This project involves the development of an **AI-driven chatbot** that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to handle customer queries automatically. The chatbot can classify queries, detect sentiment, and improve over time through continuous learning.

### Features:
- **Multi-class intent classification**: Classifies user queries into predefined categories such as 'refund request', 'technical issue', etc.
- **Sentiment analysis**: Identifies the sentiment of the user query (positive, negative, neutral).
- **24/7 Availability**: Can interact with users anytime, offering instant responses.
- **Proactive Engagement**: Encourages user feedback to enhance future interactions.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **spaCy** for text processing
- **Hugging Face Transformers (BERT)** for NLP
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms
- **Streamlit** for deploying the chatbot interface
- **Heroku** for cloud deployment
